# Exercise 12 - Find the Oldest

Given an array of objects representing people with a birth and death year, return the oldest person.

const people = [
      {
        name: "Carly",
        yearOfBirth: 1942,
        yearOfDeath: 1970,
      },
      {
        name: "Ray",
        yearOfBirth: 1962,
        yearOfDeath: 2011,
      },
      {
        name: "Jane",
        yearOfBirth: 1912,
        yearOfDeath: 1941,
      },
    ]

## Hints
- You should return the whole person object, but the tests mostly just check to make sure the name is correct.
- this can be done with a couple of chained array methods, or by using `reduce`.
- One of the tests checks for people with no death-date.. use JavaScript's Date function to get their age as of today.
